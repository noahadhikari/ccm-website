        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p><b>COVID update:</b> We are fortunate to be able to perform in-person again! The populations we perform for
          are still extremely at-risk, so all members must wear K/N95 masks while performing at senior homes (excepting
          wind players while they're actively playing).</p>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> <i>How do jam sessions and concerts work?</i>
          <br>
          <b>A:</b> Every Saturday, CCM holds a jam session from 1-3 PM for members to meet and practice followed by a
          one-hour concert monthly at a local senior home here in Berkeley. Jam sessions are held on the bottom floor of
          Morrison Hall (unless noted otherwise), which have several practice rooms for small ensembles or individuals
          to practice and a bigger lounge for larger groups. After the jam session, those attending the concert meet
          outside of Morrison Hall with the club officers and you will either walk or bus together to that week's
          nursing home (so bring your <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/StudentEasypass">Clipper Card</a> just in case!).
          At the performances, we will rotate through groups and people will take turns performing!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> <i>Are instruments provided?</i>
          <br>
          <b>A:</b> Our club currently owns one viola, one cajon, a small drumset, as well as a couple microphones,
          4-channel mixer, and speaker. If any of these interest you, please contact us so that we can bring them to our
          jam sessions. Otherwise, you must bring your own instrument(s). Our jam session and concert locations always
          have at least one piano,
          however, so fret not if you are a pianist!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I form an ensemble?</i>
          <br>
          <b>A:</b> There are many ways to meet other musicians in the club. You can either come out to our weekly jam
          sessions and meet other club members face to face, or make a post in our <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064592808214">Facebook group</a>! Our club socials are also
          an awesome way to meet other
          musicians. You can join our <a href="http://bit.ly/ccmnewsletter">mailing list</a> to learn about upcoming
          socials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> <i>Do you give music lessons?</i>
          <br>
          <b>A:</b> Our club does not officially give music lessons. Some individual members, however, may be willing
          to help you if you ask nicely! Feel free to ask around on our <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064592808214">Facebook
            group</a>.
