I was born in Australia, and by some weird reasoning was named Austin, so nope, I\'m not from Texas, I\'m from down \'undah\'. But, now I moved to U.S and now live here. I\'m going to be sophomore seeking to double major in MCB and Music. I love Classical music, in the very broad sense, Baroque to Contemporary. If i had to pick, I\'m more of a Romantic/Contemporary guy. My favorite composer is Sergei Rachmaninoff.</p><p>The great thing about CCM is that it is a great outlet for anyone to play music to people, rather than getting personal satisfaction of completing songs. Its a great way to gain performance experience and more confidence playing music to an audience. Also, I\'ve personally found it compelling to share the magic of music to everyone and the effects of helping people with it.</p><p>I hope to can get to know you in the coming concerts!!</p>');">

I love jazz, good ole\' rock and roll and consumption of vast quantities of food.  I\'ve been playing piano for ten years and drums for about five.</p><p>This is my second year with CCM and I\'m just as excited about it as the first. I love how CCM gathers people of different abilities and styles just to share their love of music.  No matter the instrument, no matter the preference of style, we don\'t care, we just want you to play.  Also, I love the food. Sweet, glorious food!</p>');">

I\'m a second year intended Computer Science major. I played the piano from age 6 to 11, but unfortunately I\'m terribly out of practice! I began learning guitar on my own when I was 13 (typical, right?), and since then I\'ve loved singing and playing for fun. My musical taste is always changing, but I\'d have to say that the artists that have stuck with me for the longest so far are Brand New, Young the Giant, Yuna, and Death Cab for Cutie.</p><p>What I love about CCM is that you don\'t have to be super pro at your instrument. The seniors love it when you come play for them no matter what, so it\'s a great way to play what you love without any pressure!</p>');">

I play the piano, guitar, and ukelele.  Some of my current favorite artists are Britt Nicole, Cassadee Pope, and Sanctus Real.</p><p>CCM is a wonderful place to continue your musical talents in a very low-stress environment.  In addition, you get to meet awesome people that you probably wouldn\'t be able to meet in your typical 300+ student lecture hall.  Not only that, you get to reach out and make the day of some pretty sweet senior citizens. Seeing the smiles on their faces and hearing their life stories are just some of the many things you will find rewarding when you join CCM.</p><p>With that said, I\'m very excited to meet you and to work on the marketing needs of CCM.</p>');">

I listen to a variety of music, like alternative/indie, hip hop, classical, and jazz, usually depending on my mood. I\'ve been playing piano for about 10 years now, and I also played piccolo/flute in the school symphony and marching band from grades 6-12 (yes, I\'m a total band geek haha). I grew up playing classical music and love it, but since college I\'ve been trying to branch out into other genres like contemporary and jazz, which I find are pretty fun to experiment with!</p><p>What I love about being part of CCM is how it brings together people who love music and jamming together. You get meet all kinds of wonderful musicians from across the spectrum and it is just a super chill way to keep up with your instrument while sharing your love of music with others.</p>');">
